                <p>These Terms of Use (the “Terms”) are a binding contract between you and SURFIX\WAVETRAK, INC. (“SURFIX,” “we” and “us”). Your use of the Services in any way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you use the Services. You represent and warrant that you are an individual of legal age to form a binding contract (or if not, you represent and warrant that you are at least 16 years of age and have received your parent’s or guardian’s permission to use the Services and have gotten your parent or guardian to agree to these Terms on your behalf).

                <p>Please read these Terms carefully. They cover important information about Services provided to you and any charges, taxes, and fees we bill you. These Terms include information about future changes to these Terms, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, a class action waiver, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.

                <h3>Will SURFIX ever change the Services?</h3>
                <p>We’re always trying to improve our Products and Services, so they may change over time. We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services. We’ll try to give you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you, but this isn’t always practical. We reserve the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), in our sole discretion, and without notice.</p>
    
                <h3>Will these Terms ever change?</h3>
                <p>We are constantly trying to improve our Products and Services, so these Terms may need to change along with our Products and Services. We res
                    serve the right to change the Terms at any time by posting modified Terms on our website(s) and mobile applications and changing the “Last Updated” date below so you know when the new terms took effect. When changes to the Terms are made, we may also place a notice on our site located at , send you an email, and/or notify you by some other means. You agree to review these Terms from time to time so that you are aware of any changes.</p>
    
                <p>If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services. If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.</p>
    
                <p>Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.</p>
